# Halo-Dino-Run-Evolved

The inspiration for this game was the Chrome Dinosaur game that you can play when you use google chrome and have no interenet. The designs for the characters was inspired by the game Halo, owned by MIcrosoft.

uses howler.js CDN for sound event handling.

WARNING: Must be ran using a live server or the sounds will not run! Some events are dependent on the sounds and will therefore make the game unplayable!

BUGS: Pressing spacebar during starting sequence before you are given instructions to do so starts the game underneath the starting sequence and will break the game. Spamming spacebar during the game spams music on top of itself as well as reduces the timer by about a couple seconds each press, effectively making a way to cheat to get to the end immediately. spamming spacebar at the "victory" screen plays the music on top of each other similiar to what would happen if you spammed it during the game.
